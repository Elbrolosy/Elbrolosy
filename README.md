### Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Omar Elbrolosy

I'm a software engineer seeking for technical challenges and innovative solutions.
No matter what tools, where to deploy, on which platform, just let me challenge it, architect it and code it.

Yes, I'm interested more in cloud solutions, Saas and web applications in general, and I'm so excited currently to keep learning more concepts and even frameworks related to the web in order to widen my skills and knowledge base, but I belive in the truth that says software engineering is a craft .. so just with a little breif, a good developer might delve into any code base and start crafting ðŸ˜…. Oh about the truth, actually it's a craft with a tie or something ðŸ˜‚

I'm currently working as a Senior Backend Software Engieer at adam.ai, I have mission and I'm here until getting it accomplished ðŸ˜Ž.
